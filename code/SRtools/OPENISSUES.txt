1. PROBABLY SOLVED: I need to validate the way a calculate probability volumes on dthetas for log/non_log spaces.
Currently I assume the volume is prod(dtheta) but thinking about it maybe its fine (if zero in one dimentions it all should be 0 so you need to multiply)


2. saving with prior should be deprecated. should solve how to save if already applied prior
